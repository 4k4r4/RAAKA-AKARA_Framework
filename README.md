# RAAKA-AKARA Framework
## Description
The cybersecurity domain can be broadly categorized into two primary areas: attack and defense. Within the industry, these concepts are often referred to as "red teaming" and "blue teaming," respectively. While individuals may specialize in one of these areas, a comprehensive understanding of both is essential for becoming a truly successful cybersecurity professional.

A red teamer simulates malicious attacks to identify vulnerabilities in a system or network. To be effective, a red teamer must possess a deep understanding of blue team tactics, including detection methods, IDS and IPS evasion techniques, and the operation of IDS and IPS. This knowledge allows the red teamer to anticipate and circumvent defensive measures.

Conversely, a blue teamer is responsible for defending against cyber threats. To excel in this role, a blue teamer must possess a thorough understanding of hacker methodologies, including attack tactics, techniques, and strategies. This knowledge enables the blue teamer to proactively identify and mitigate potential risks.

The RAAKA-AKARA Framework provides a unified approach to red teaming and blue teaming activities. By combining elements of both disciplines, this framework offers a comprehensive methodology for security professionals to enhance their effectiveness in protecting systems and networks.

## Special Note
This framework is designed to be used solely for the purpose of enhancing security. It is not intended to be employed for malicious or harmful activities. Individuals utilizing this framework are strongly encouraged to adhere to ethical principles and avoid any actions that could cause harm or disruption to others. By applying this framework responsibly, security professionals can conduct comprehensive assessments and implement measures to protect and improve the security posture of organizations.

## Standardization
### RAAKA
RAAKA is the red teaming component of the RAAKA-AKARA framework, dedicated to establishing a comprehensive methodology for conducting ethical cyberattacks. RAAKA stands for,
- R - Reconnaissance
- A - Acumen
- A - Access
- K - Kindle
- A - Abscondence

### AKARA
AKARA is the blue teaming component of the RAAKA-AKARA framework, specializing in the development of a comprehensive methodology for effectively identifying, detecting, and responding to cyberattacks. AKARA stands for,
- A - Analyze
- K - Keep
- A - Ascertain
- R - React
- A - Arise

## Core
By integrating RAAKA and AKARA, the framework enables a comprehensive mapping of the potential phases of red teaming activities with those of blue teaming. For instance, if a red team professional commences a simple network discovery during the reconnaissance phase of RAAKA, a blue team professional can identify the attack in the initial phase of AKARA and implement proactive countermeasures. Conversely, a red team professional can also identify the detection phase of their attack and able to take preventative measures to avoid detection. This collaborative approach exemplifies the mapping process within the RAAKA-AKARA Framework.
